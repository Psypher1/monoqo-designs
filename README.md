# Monoqo Designs Site

This is a rework of the site of Monoqo Designs.
After trying out a number of things, my initial thoughts for it were correct.

## Tech Used:

- HTML
- scss
- javascript

Notes: Using images for page content may look fine, but it breaks down when interactions get involved. It also becomes a nightmare when responsiveness comes into play.

## Font face

The font folder and \_font-face.scss were an attempt to creating a web font.
In the end the Inter font from google was a better option
